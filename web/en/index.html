    <p><b>About the Playground</b></p>
    <p>
        The Lox Playground lets you run your own Lox script in your browser,
        with WASM version of <a href="https://github.com/nanmu42/bluelox" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BlueLox</a>,
        a tree-walking interpreter implemented in Golang for Lox.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lox is a programing language by Robert Nystrom, introduced in his wonderful book
        <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crafting Interpreters</a>,
        where he constructs a Java version interpreter(jlox) line by line, with detailed explanation
        and full packs of jokes about breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may find the Lox Playground helpful during your learning and coding as it may be your stage
        for trial-and-error and implementation reference.
    </p>
    <p>
        The implementation of <a href="https://github.com/nanmu42/bluelox" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BlueLox</a>
        is almost identical to jlox, except:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The error message is not the same word by word, although the efforts making them semantically equal has been made.</li>
        <li>A extra native function, <code>sleep(millisecond)</code>, is added to support playground example.</li>
        <li>BlueLox takes care of comments during lexing and parsing, so that <code>loxfmt</code> works.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Browser WASM support is required. Raise questions and issues to
        <a href="https://github.com/nanmu42/bluelox" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BlueLox Repo</a>
        if the need arises. Stars, suggestions and contributions are welcome.

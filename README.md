# BlueLox

BlueLox is a Tree-walking interpreter implemented in Golang for Lox.

Lox is a programing language by Robert Nystrom, 
introduced in his wonderful book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), 
where he constructs a Java version interpreter(jlox) line by line, 
with detailed tutorial, brilliant illustrations and a full pack of jokes about breakfast.

You may find the Lox Playground helpful during your learning and coding as it may be your stage
for trial-and-error and implementation reference.

Works in Progress:

While the interpreter itself is ready, Lox Playground is still under development,
so there's still lots of sharp corners.
